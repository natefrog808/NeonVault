## 2. KYBER Deep Dive: Explore the CRYSTALS-KYBER Implementation

The **KYBER Deep Dive** document provides an in-depth exploration of the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm, tailored for developers and cryptographers who want to understand the underlying mechanics and implementation choices in NeonVault Crypto.

### 2.1 Introduction to Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **Why It Matters**: Quantum computers threaten classical algorithms like RSA and ECC by efficiently solving problems such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms.
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography**: Relies on the hardness of lattice problems, believed to resist quantum attacks, making it a cornerstone of post-quantum security.

### 2.2 The CRYSTALS-KYBER Algorithm
- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Based on the **Module Learning With Errors (MLWE)** problem.
  - Involves solving noisy linear equations over polynomial rings, where the noise ensures computational hardness even against quantum adversaries.
- **Key Generation**:
  - Generates a public key (matrix A and vector t) and a private key (vector s) with added noise.
  - Uses polynomial arithmetic and modular operations.
- **Encryption**:
  - Combines the public key with random noise and the message to produce a ciphertext.
  - Ensures indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA).
- **Decryption**:
  - Uses the private key to remove noise and recover the original message.
  - Incorporates error correction to handle small noise discrepancies.

### 2.3 Implementation in NeonVault
- **Parameter Choices**:
  - **Kyber-512**: Lightweight, suitable for low-security applications.
  - **Kyber-768**: Default, balanced security and performance.
  - **Kyber-1024**: High security for critical applications.
- **Optimizations**:
  - **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)**: Accelerates polynomial multiplication.
  - Efficient modular arithmetic and vector operations tailored for modern hardware.
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks.
  - Secure memory management to avoid leakage of sensitive data.

### 2.4 Using KYBER Securely
- **Choosing Security Levels**: Match the parameter set (512, 768, 1024) to your applicationâ€™s threat model.
- **Integration**: Pair KYBER with symmetric encryption (e.g., AES-GCM) for hybrid schemes ensuring both quantum resistance and data integrity.
